## Desk

The desk is made of 2 components. The table top is not made anymore but it's solid wood from IKEA and the legs are from Autonomous

- [Sony ZVE-1](https://amzn.to/3HFtmC8) as my main camera for [reels](https://instagram.com/heyjaywilson) and [videos](https://youtube.com/heyjaywilson)
- [Sony ECM-M1](https://amzn.to/4kNNBfi) is the microphone usually on the ZVE-1
- [DJI Mic 2](https://amzn.to/3HFuoy0) is the other microphone I use when I need to be further away from the camera
