## Bio
I currently work at an [startup](https://matter.xyz/) as an iOS developer. When not working, I'm updating iHog or making some kind of [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@heyjaywilson), or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/heyjaywilson) post.

A good place to find me is at a coffee shop. I enjoy well roasted coffee and love supporting local shops and roasteries. Usually I find at least one shop to go to while traveling. If I'm at home, I'll normally bring my laptop with me to finish whatever task I'm working on.

## Hobbies

Aside from coding, I enjoy photography and videography. I just like to create content to document my experiences and share them with others. My wife and I also enjoy exploring new places and playing board games.

## This site
