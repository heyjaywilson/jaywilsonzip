Ranked preferred ways to contact me:

1. [Mastodon](https://iosdev.space/@heyjaywilson) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/heyjaywilson.com): Quickest way to get in touch for something small.
2. Phone number: If you have it, message me and I'll respond quicker than anything else.
3. Email: heyjay@omg.lol will be the slowest but I'll get to it.

Just some things to note:

- I technically have a Twitter/X account, but I don't use it. It's there to save my username.
- Instagram is okay for DMing as well (@heyjaywilson) but I won't see it as quickly as the options listed above.
