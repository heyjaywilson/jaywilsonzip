I was asked by a friend to list off my main 6 interests, so I thought that might make a good blog post. These are listed in most to least interested.

1. Software development. This could be dwindled down to just Swift development, but sometimes I like to cross into web dev.
2. Videography and photography. I like cameras and tech, so this was a no brainer. I enjoy taking the photos, recording the video, and the editing process.
3. Taylor Swift.
4. Off roading. I don't do it often, but I am interested in it and do look it up quite a bit. Before the administration ruins public lands, I'm hoping to go out when it's a bit dryer and explore.
5. Corgis.
6. Hockey. I root for the Seattle Kraken, Minnesota Wild, and Minnesota Frost.

I'm pretty confident in this order, but I do have many more interests.
