I'm not sure what to do now. I'm scared. I've been scared since the election. I moved so we could live in a state that offered us more protections and rights, but with every day and every executive order, I'm not sure how much protection we will have and for how long.

I am really hoping that something will be done to stop this dictatorship from getting stronger, but that hope is fading with each passing day.

So I'm asking, now what? What am I supposed to do? How do I continue to exist when the government is shifting so radically and so quickly?
