If we go to a restaurant together, I’ll order an old fashioned. It’s a standard drink that most places can make, and I like bourbon, well now I like bourbon. I didn't like bourbon before.

I started drinking old fashions mainly because I thought they were “manly”. It’s kind of silly now that I think and write about it, but it’s true and I’m not alone in this idea. I have a friend who says she started drinking beer because “that’s what lesbians do”. 

It's interesting thinking how certain actions help you feel more connected to your identity due to social norms. It just makes me wonder how society shapes how we see ourselves.
