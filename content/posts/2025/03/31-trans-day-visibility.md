I don’t talk about this too much here, and I think today is a good day to do it. I’m Jay and I’m a trans man. My pronouns are he/him. I started posting on socials, streaming, and making YouTube content as a way to represent people I didn’t see a lot of in tech and I am going to continue that.

Today is Trans Day of Visibility which is a day celebrated in the community to just raise awareness about transgender people. We exist and just want to exist without discrimination as most people do. Today is my 2nd Transgender Day of Visibility since figuring myself out, and I’ve just gotten to be a better and happier version of me since, as most trans people do.
