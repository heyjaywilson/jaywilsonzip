At the beginning of October, I set out on a lofty goal, [$1000 MRR](https://youtu.be/WRvNgOdpxPU?si=GT048Ab_DWMgZHq4) by this time next year (October 2026). I meant to make a blog post, but I forgot in classic Jay fashion.

My starting stats:

| App | Subscribers | MRR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iHog | 28 | $28 |
| Camp Notes | 1 | $2 |
| Coffee_ | 0 | 0 |
| Universe Converter| 0 | 0 |

## October

To help achieve the MRR, I decided to make smaller goals each mopnth that will hopefully help me. For October those were:

- Redesigning and fully implementing RevenueCat paywalls in [iHog](https://ihog.cctplus.dev/)
- Asking for reviews in [Camp Notes](https://campnotes.app) and write 3 blog posts to help SEO to the website
- Adding analytics and adjusting the paywall view in Universe Converter
- Adding analytics and RevenueCat to [Coffee_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coffee/id1611166034)
- Get to $50/MRR

Here is what I ended up doing.

- iHog got exactly what I implemented and I am running a pricing test in the US to see if I can charge a higher price.
- Camp Notes ratings and reviews are being asked for, a new paywall is being experimented with, which you can read [here](/posts/2025/10/15-0821-campnotes-paywall/). I did not end up writing the 3 blog posts.
- Universe Converter did not get a hard paywall or a RevenueCat paywall because I decided to just keep it as a tip jar. There is not anything I feel comfortable with charging.
- I ended up not working at all on coffee_ ðŸ™ƒ I ran out of time.

What did I end with stats wise?

| App | Subscribers | MRR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iHog | 42 | $30 |
| Camp Notes | 4 | $10 |
| Coffee_ | 0 | 0 |
| Universe Converter| 0 | 0 |

I am sitting at $40 MRR, which means I am like $10 short of my goal, but the subscriber numbers increased which is good and the right direction.

## What's next?

Well I started working on a new app [JABA](https://www.threads.com/@heyjaywilson/post/DQMci05kWl8?xmt=AQF0W5ShMAVYmTUbHWTgr7X5sfOA3z49dxmjaEbFQshyig) that will take a lot of my focus away from Coffee_ and Universe Converter. I just don't see those two apps being something I really want to work on long term. JABA is a revamp of PocketBudget that I worked on earlier this year. I just wanted to start from scratch and with no pressure from existing baggage.

#### iHog

- Add in a free trial to the monthly product and see if that moves subscriptions
- Figure out what is causing all the crashes

#### Camp Notes

- Write at least one blog post
- Improve load times on the Campground List
- Start working towards Scout Badges, which are in app achievements

Here's to November and see if I can keep the needle going up!
