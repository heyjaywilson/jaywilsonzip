After some back and forth, Apple approved Camp Notes ðŸŽ‰

The last reason it was not approved was because subscriptions needed an account, which I challenged and then it was approved.

Here are some stats since launching:

- Downloads: 23
- Impressions: 778
- Trials started: 1
- Crashes: 0
- Visits made: 3

Here is how I am interpreting these numbers:
- My keywords need to be adjusted for more impressions. Let's be honest "Camp" is probably overloaded, so I need better keywords for better search.
- I need better marketing. I need to write more blog posts on [campnotes.app](https://campnotes.app?utm_campaign=build-in-public) to drive more organic content. I need to create social media content to get a wider audience. There's just a lot of marketing I can do.
- There just isn't enough campgrounds in the app to entice users to add visits. I prioritized being able to add camp grounds and getting the app out without making sure there were campgrounds in the app that people could add visits to. I think this is making the app seem bare. After v1.1.0 is out, I'm going to work on getting more data into the app.
- It's been 1 week. It's been 1 week so I still just need to chill and focus on making a good app.

It's time to work on RevenueCat's Shipaton materials though.
