I started HRT to medically transition in August of 2023. Since then I had the expected changes, small weight distribution and voice change mainly. I had heard that testosterone could change a person's foot-size but being that I was 29 when I started and fully grown, I didn't think it would happen to me. I was wrong. Today, I received an order for a new pair of shoes I already owned but 1/2 a size bigger.

I **now** have 4 pairs of shoes that fit me, a winterized pair of Vans that I bought too big at the time but needed for a trip, a pair of hiking boots, a pair of Thursday boots, and now these [Reeboks](https://www.reebok.com/products/reebok-club-c-85-vintage-shoes-chalk-paperwhite-glen-green-103162).

I knew my foot had grown in December because my parents gave me the [Thursday boots](https://amzn.to/4iYKiBt) as a birthday gift but they were too small when I received them. I just didn't want to replace my sneakers yet since it's been too wet to not wear the other shoes. Now that it's starting to rain a smidge less in the PNW, I'll probably be making more show purchases.
