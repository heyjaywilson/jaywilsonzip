description: Cleaning off the desk to get ready for the work week
---

I let my desk get a bit messy over the last couple of weeks, so it's time to clean it up. I think I work a bit better when there's not a lot of clutter and sometimes it's hard for me to find the difference between clutter and decoration. I can say for sure I had too much clutter with all the papers I recycled today.
