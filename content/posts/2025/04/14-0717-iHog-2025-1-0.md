description: First release of iHog in 2025.
draft: true
---

I've released my first release of iHog this year. I wanted this release to do more than a bug fix, but that's what it is. ETC is releasing a new version of [Hog](https://www.etcconnect.com/About/News/ETC-Unveils-the-Next-Generation-Hog.aspx?LangType=1033), so I need to get the code base ready for potential changes. This meant pausing my [Show Notes](https://github.com/CCTPlus/ihogApp/issues/39) feature that I spent way too long trying to get right. I think I did figure out my issue there so it should be able to be added soon after Hog 5 support.

## User Highlights

- User profile sheet
    - Allows a user to test new features via a code
	- Adds the ability to mass delete objects and shows
- Fixes an issue where a user couldn't delete a show

## Developer Highlights

- No more Core Data.
    - This release moves everything over to Swift Data and removes all Core Data related files.
- Moved files around in the repo
    - This allows [Alex: AI for Xcode](https://www.alexcodes.app/) to work better on packages

I'll make more posts about some of the pains I went through with Swift Data, but for now feel free to check out the code as iHog's code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CCTPlus/ihogApp/tree/2025.1.0).
